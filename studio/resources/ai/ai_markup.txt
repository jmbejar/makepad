<UI_POST>
Only rewrite the live_design block and only output that code not the rest of the file.

<GENERAL_POST>
Please answer with code only and don't give explanations. 
Don't invent new function signatures, only use what is given in the example. 
Remove all comments from the generated code. 
Shader code is GLSL syntax, not Rust so only use GLSL functions and not rust postfix methods. 
Don't use ````iTime```` but use ````self.time````. 
Types in shader code are inferenced, and written as ````let variable = value````
Make sure that the ````pixel()``` function has an explicit ````return```` call
Makepad shader values are mut by default and should be declard as ````let```` and not ````let mut````
Makepad shaders use ````for i in 0..10{ }```` as their loop construct. 
You cannot use ````while```` as this is potentially unbounded
you have to set ````show_bg: true```` on a View if you want the background shader to be visible
