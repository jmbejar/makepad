Generate the whole file including the Rust logic.

<UI_POST>
Only rewrite the live_design block and only output that code not the rest of the file.

Please answer with code only and don't give explanations. 
Don't invent new function signatures, only use what is given in the example. 
Remove all comments from the generated code. 
Shader code is GLSL syntax, not Rust so only use GLSL functions and not rust postfix methods. 
Don't use ````iTime```` but use ````self.time````. 
Types in shader code are inferenced, and written as ````let variable = value````
Make sure that the ````pixel()``` function has an explicit ````return```` call
Makepad shader values are mut by default and should be declard as ````let```` and not ````let mut````
Makepad shaders use ````for i in 0..10{ }```` as their loop construct. 
You cannot use ````while```` as this is potentially unbounded
you have to set ````show_bg: true```` on a View if you want the background shader to be visible
remember that return types for the shaders are written rust style: ````fn pixel(self)->vec4{}````
Local function for the shader cannot be placed inside the ````pixel```` function but need to be inside the draw_bg scope and before the pixel function. Please remember to write the function type signature in the declaration rust-style `````
fn thing(a:vec3, b:vec4)->vec4```` 
Please remember to give functions an explicit ````return```` call, it is like GLSL and not like Rust with an automatic return value.
If you use ````self.time```` make sure the first function argument is called ````self```` and the function is called as ````self.functionname()````
Shader code does not support the ````f32```` type but needs to use ````float```` instead
You cannot cast an int to a float with ````i as float```` but you have to write it as ````float(i)````
Constant definitions can only be inside functions and not at the root ````draw_bg```` block
Make sure that when you call a method ````self.fnclall```` that the first argument in the declaration is ````fn fncall(self)
If you call a method on self call ````fncall```` make sure the first argument on the function declaration is ````(self)````
